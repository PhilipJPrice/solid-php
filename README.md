## Single-Responsibility Principle (Branch)
Each class should have one and only one purpose and/or reason to change.

## Open-Closed Principle (Branch)
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle (Branch)
Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## Interface Segregation Principle (Branch)
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use, or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (Branch)
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions, i.e. high-level modules must not depend on a low-level modules, rather they should both depend on abstractions.
